Crime Rate Mapping is a website application which takes the data set of crime records of a city and demonstrates where and when it occurred on a map. The goal of the project is to help the users get a general idea of what areas of a city to avoid if they intend to travel to a new city they have never been to before. This application can be useful for tourists, those seeking potential areas for a new home, emergency services or even college students that are new to a city.
